# final_assignment_on_flutter

This is my attempt to convert my dart console application to a mobile app.
All images are made with chatGPT, but everything else is made by me, only using google as help.
I didn't use chatGPT for the code, since I wanted it to be authentic, and so I would learn more.

In many classes I used the String routeManagerLocation, or something like it. This was the best way
I found to use classes over several files. In here I always use RouteManager.(screen I will go to).
I use this to navigate between different screens.

It doesn't have all the features that the console version did, and made a few changes along the way,
since converting to flutter forced some changes

I added screenshots of most of the features, but not all of the different screens, since this would
be a lot of screenshots.

I added a gap of 10 between all buttons. This made the phone version a little uglier, but the web
version much prettier
