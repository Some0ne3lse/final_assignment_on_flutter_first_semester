# final_assignment_on_flutter

This is my attempt to convert my dart console application to a mobile app.
All pictures are made with chatGPT, but everything else made by me, only using google as help.

I wanted to have a separate class for the examination in rooms, but I couldn't get the boolean to
work. I could have used

myItemsList.any((item) => item.itemId == myitem.itemId); 

which I did in earlier code, but I had issues with this in dead_bob, so I used the boolean to check
whether or not I've taken an item or not.
